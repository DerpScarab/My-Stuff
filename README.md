Overview:
Battleship - a local and maybe online game of battleship

Project Blitz - a fighting game that uses a punch, kick, jump, and block button with directional inputs. Music is a background beat with the hits making drum sounds. Dash Attack Mode - a minimalist fighter with a two button control scheme. Hold left or right to move, double tap forwards to dash attack, double tap back to jump forwards, double tap forwards in the air to dash attack forwards, and double tap backwards in the air to dash at a 45* angle downwards. Characters take 3 hits before they get KO'd.

Project Street - a sprite-based top-down person racing game reminiscent of Initial D. There are three teirs of cars, with T1 having a stat total of 60, T2 with 75, and T3 with 100. The three stats are Acceleration, Speed, and Handling. Within Handling, there is the type of cornering (drift or grip), the weight (the car's actual weight, impacting corner speed/acceleration), the maximum drift angle (raw Handeling stat), and max cornering speed (3 x Handeling Stat). Downhill Boost: (grade x 10), Uphill Resistence: -1(grade x 5)

2DACM - 2D Air Combat Simulator - a multiplayer team-based twin-stick shooter that you fly to and from the combat zone to refuel, reload, and heal. Four different game modes will be available online:
	WW1-Slow but maneuverable planes with no missiles and limited gun range, 6v6 
	WW2-Faster but less maneuverable planes with no missiles but unlimited gun range, 5v5
	Modern-Average planes with both guns and missiles, 4v4
